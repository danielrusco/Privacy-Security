**What free services help you stay private & secure?**

**Password Manager** - A password manager generates and stores strong, unique passwords for every account you have. Reusing passwords is one of the most common ways accounts get compromised — when one service gets breached, attackers try those credentials everywhere else. A password manager eliminates that risk while making it practical to have genuinely strong passwords without memorizing them. Bitwarden is a free, open-source option; 1Password is a polished paid alternative.

**2FA App** — A TOTP app (Ente Auth, 2FAS) or hardware key (YubiKey) adds a second layer of protection so that a stolen password alone isn't enough to access your accounts.

**Secure Messaging** — Signal is the standard recommendation. Unlike SMS or most chat apps, Signal uses end-to-end encryption for messages and calls, stores minimal metadata, and is open-source and independently audited.

**Private Search Engine** — Your search history is one of the most revealing datasets about you, and Google retains it indefinitely. Switching to something like Brave Search or Kagi removes that data collection entirely. DuckDuckGo is a popular option but routes some queries through Bing.

**DNS** (free or paid) - Every time you visit a website, your device makes a DNS request — essentially a lookup that translates a domain name into an IP address. By default, these requests go to your ISP's DNS servers, which can log every site you visit. Switching to a privacy-respecting resolver like NextDNS or Quad9 encrypts those lookups and prevents your ISP from seeing your browsing history through DNS. NextDNS also lets you configure custom blocklists, adding ad and tracker blocking at the network level on top of whatever your browser does.
