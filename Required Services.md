**What services do you need to stay private & secure?**

Password Manager (free) - A password manager generates and stores strong, unique passwords for every account you have. Reusing passwords is one of the most common ways accounts get compromised — when one service gets breached, attackers try those credentials everywhere else. A password manager eliminates that risk while making it practical to have genuinely strong passwords without memorizing them. Bitwarden is a free, open-source option; 1Password is a polished paid alternative.
Secure Email (paid) - Most mainstream email providers (Gmail, Outlook) scan your emails to build advertising profiles and comply readily with data requests. A privacy-focused provider like Proton Mail stores your email with end-to-end encryption, meaning even Proton can't read your messages. It's also based in Switzerland, which has stronger privacy laws than the US. This is especially important for sensitive personal, legal, or financial correspondence.
Email Alias Service (paid) - An alias service lets you create unique, disposable email addresses that forward to your real inbox. Instead of giving your actual email to every service you sign up for, you give them an alias. If that alias starts receiving spam or gets breached, you simply delete it — your real address stays clean and unconnected. Services like SimpleLogin and Addy.io make this easy, and iCloud+ includes a built-in version called Hide My Email.
VPN (paid) - A VPN encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a server operated by the VPN provider, masking your activity from your ISP, mobile carrier, and anyone on the same network. This is particularly useful on public WiFi and prevents your carrier from building a profile of your browsing habits. It's worth understanding that a VPN shifts trust rather than eliminating it — you're trusting the VPN provider instead of your ISP, so choosing one with a strict no-logs policy and independent audits (like Mullvad) matters.
DNS (free or paid) - Every time you visit a website, your device makes a DNS request — essentially a lookup that translates a domain name into an IP address. By default, these requests go to your ISP's DNS servers, which can log every site you visit. Switching to a privacy-respecting resolver like NextDNS or Quad9 encrypts those lookups and prevents your ISP from seeing your browsing history through DNS. NextDNS also lets you configure custom blocklists, adding ad and tracker blocking at the network level on top of whatever your browser does.Any services I'm forgetting?3:57 PMCatalogued additional privacy and security tools comprehensivelyCatalogued additional privacy and security tools comprehensivelyLet me think about what other privacy/security services might be worth adding to this list.
2FA App (free) — Probably worth including given how foundational it is. A TOTP app (Ente Auth, 2FAS) or hardware key (YubiKey) adds a second layer of protection so that a stolen password alone isn't enough to access your accounts.
Secure Messaging (free) — Signal is the standard recommendation. Unlike SMS or most chat apps, Signal uses end-to-end encryption for messages and calls, stores minimal metadata, and is open-source and independently audited.
Private Search Engine (free) — Your search history is one of the most revealing datasets about you, and Google retains it indefinitely. Switching to something like Brave Search or Kagi removes that data collection entirely. DuckDuckGo is a popular option but routes some queries through Bing.
Encrypted Cloud Storage (paid) — If you're storing files in the cloud, services like Proton Drive or Filen encrypt your files before they leave your device, meaning the provider can't see your content. A step up from iCloud even with Advanced Data Protection enabled.
Data Broker Removal (paid) — Services like Optery or Deleteme find and request removal of your personal information from data broker sites that aggregate and sell public records. More of an ongoing maintenance service than a tool, but addresses a threat vector the others don't touch.


**Privacy Isn't Free**

Cheapest Diverse Stack - $10.87/month
- $0.99 iCloud+ subscription for email aliases
- $3.99 "Mail Plus" Proton subscription
- $5.90 Mullvad VPN subscription 
- $0.00 BitWarden account 

Cheapest Siloed Stack - $9.99/month
- Proton Unlimited subscription, which covers email aliases, email services, VPN, & password manager. Downside is that all you eggs are in one basket. Bonus is that you also get 500GB of encrypted storage vs only 50GB with iCloud+, which is only encrypted if "Advanced Data Protection" is enabled. 

What I Currently Use - $25.70/month
- $2.99 iCloud+ subscription for email aliases, will be trying to downsize to the $0.99 plan once I clean out my iCloud storage. I really like how easy it is to setup new email aliases on my iPhone. However, it's much more tedious on my MacBook. Since I started with iCloud+ aliases, it's not worth switching to a dedicated alias service at this point. 
- $3.99 "Mail Plus" Proton subscription. I bought a yearly subscription when it was on sale, so my monthly price is lower by 20-25%. 
- $5.90 Mullvad VPN subscription. Bonus: one of my Mullvad devices is my router, so all home network traffic is tunneled through Mullvad. Speaking of routers, I'm a big fan of [GLiNet](https://www.gl-inet.com/) routers. They're simple to use and have VPN (including Tailscale) & AdGuard integrated into their interface. 
- $10.00/year BitWarden account, because I want to support BitWarden. I don't need or use the extra features. 
- $11.99 for [Optery](https://www.optery.com/) data broker removal service. I'll do this for a few months every few years, but not all the time. 
- I plan to test out Obscura as a VPN to see if I like it over Mullvad. It's basically Mullvad + iCloud Relay at the same time, which makes it impossible for Obscura to see your data. Pretty cool.
