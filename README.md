A place to share privacy &amp; security related information. 

# General Best Practices for Privacy & Security

## Accounts & Identity
- Use a password manager and don't reuse passwords.
- Enable 2FA on all accounts where possible.
- Use a unique username (not your real name or consistent handle) across unrelated services.
- Use unique email aliases per service so breaches can be traced and contained.
- Regularly check [HaveIBeenPwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see if your credentials have appeared in known breaches.
- Remove old accounts you no longer use — dormant accounts are a liability.

## Communication
- Use a private email service.
- Use an email alias service.
- Use an end-to-end encrypted messaging app (Signal) for sensitive conversations.
- Be cautious about what you share in SMS — it's unencrypted and retained by carriers.

## Browsing & Networking
- Use a privacy-focused search engine.
- Use a VPN, especially on public WiFi.
- Use a privacy-respecting DNS resolver.
- Install an adblocker — ads are a meaningful malware and tracking vector, not just an annoyance.

## Devices
- Keep your device software up to date.
- Encrypt your devices (most modern phones do this by default; laptops often require enabling it manually — FileVault on Mac, BitLocker on Windows).
- Use a strong, unique PIN or passphrase on all devices.
- Enable remote wipe on your devices.

## Data Hygiene
- Regularly audit app permissions (location, microphone, camera, contacts).
- Opt out of data broker listings, or use a service like Optery to automate removal.
- Be thoughtful about what you store in the cloud and with whom.

## Social Engineering
- Be skeptical of unsolicited messages asking you to click links or verify credentials — phishing is still the most common attack vector.
- Verify unexpected requests from known contacts through a separate channel before acting.
